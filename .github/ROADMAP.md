# Development Roadmap

This is a 'to do list' of features which are incomplete, in the works, or otherwise on my radar to add in the future. 

## Required Features

Features which *must* be added before the next major release

* Full documentation 
    * Rpgcard documentation needs completing


## Desired Features

Features which would improve the package

* RpgClocks
* Character sheet interface/class
* Encounter tables / random tables / dice tables
* Full page images / landscape support
* `Fancy box' (i.e. the D&D class table wrapper environment)
* Circle/dot producers & fill-ins (i.e. for FitD skills)


## Internal Mechanics

Features which would improve the developer experience, but would not affect the user interface

* Complete the transition to the __rpg_add_key interface to simplify
