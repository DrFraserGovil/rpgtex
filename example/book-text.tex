	\chapter{Introduction}


	\RpgDropCap{H}{ello and welcome!} This package is designed to aid you in writing beautifully typeset documents for a variety of RPG documents. It is derived from {a D\&D-specific package}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template}}, but whilst we have retained much of the internal engine, we have adapted it to work with a variety of themes, thus making it a system-agnostic \verb|rpgtex|.

	This document - along with a few others - serves as a showcase of the different themes and classes available. We begin with the basic framework for the book class, and then move on to demonstrate the theme-specific options.

	\chapter{Sections}
		Sections follow the standard \LaTeX{} formatting; with the chapter formatting shown above.
		\section{Section}
			Sections break up chapters into large groups of associated text.

			\subsection{Subsection}
				Subsections further break down the information for the reader.

				\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
					Subsubsections are the furthest division of text that still have a block header. Below this level, headers are displayed inline.

					\paragraph{Paragraph}
					The paragraph format is seldom used in the core books, but is available if you prefer it to the ``normal'' style.

					\subparagraph{Subparagraph}
					The subparagraph format with the paragraph indent is likely going to be more familiar to the reader.
			\subsection{Parts}

				The rpgbook class also defines a \verb|part| (seen in the prior pages).

				Parts are often allowed to define a full-page image

		% \section{Map Regions}
		% 	The map region functions \verb|\RpgArea| and \verb|\RpgSubArea| provide automatic numbering of areas.


		% 	\RpgSetAreaOptions[area-label=village,area-num-depth=3]{}
		% 	\RpgArea{Village of Hommlet}
		% 	This is the village of hommlet.
		% 	\RpgSetAreaOptions[area-label=villages,area-num-depth=3]{}
		% 	\RpgSubArea{Inn of the Welcome Wench}
		% 	Inside the village is the inn of the Welcome Wench.

		% 	\RpgSubArea{Blacksmith's Forge}
		% 	There's a blacksmith in town, too.

		% 	\RpgArea{Foo's Castle}
		% 	This is foo's home, a hovel of mud and sticks.

		% 	\RpgSubArea{Moat}
		% 	This ditch has a board spanning it.

		% 	\RpgSubArea{Entrance}
		% 	A five-foot hole reveals the dirt floor illuminated by a hole in the roof.




		% 	\subsection{Resetting Counters}

		% 		The counters can be reset
		% 	\RpgSetAreaOptions[area-label=space]{}
		% 	\RpgResetAreas{}
		% 	\RpgArea{Nyxia Subsector}
		% 		A dangerous region of space, accessed only by calling \verb|\RpgReset{}|
		% 		\RpgSubArea{Crescent Station}
		% 			A lawless hub of trade and crime
		% 		\RpgSubArea{Raxxla Penal Colony}
		% 			An ice planet populated with criminals

		% 	\RpgArea{Great Expanse}
		% 		A void of nothingness

		% 	\subsection{Referencing Map Regions}

		% 		Map regions are referenceable; so \verb|\RpgAreaRef[area-label=village]{Village of Hommlet}| is ``\RpgAreaRef[area-label=village]{Village of Hommlet}''

		% 		When using reset-counters or otherwise ambiguous names, it is necessary to use \verb|\RpgSetAreaOptions[area-label={},sub-area-label={}]{}| to define prefixes to disambiguate.

		% 	\subsection{Area Depths}

		% 		Map headers can be set to different `levels', using either section/subsection (etc.) for display purposes. The default value is \verb|\RpgSetAreaOptions[area-num-depth=2]{}| (subsection). For display purposes here, we used \verb|area-num-depth=3|
		\section{RpgTable}

			\begin{RpgTable}[title=Box Colors]{lX}
  Color            &  Description \\
  |commentcolor|   & |DndComment| background \\
  |readaloudcolor| & |DndReadAloud| background \\
  |sidebarcolor|   & |DndSidebar| background \\
  |tablecolor|     & background of even |DndTable| rows \\
\end{RpgTable}
\begin{RpgTable}{lX}
  Color            &  Description \\
  |commentcolor|   & |DndComment| background \\
  |readaloudcolor| & |DndReadAloud| background \\
  |sidebarcolor|   & |DndSidebar| background \\
  |tablecolor|     & background of even |DndTable| rows \\
\end{RpgTable}
	\section{Text Boxes}

	The module has three environments for setting text apart so that it is drawn to the reader's attention. |DndReadAloud| is used for text that a game master would read aloud.
	\section{Tips \& Tricks}
	The other two environments are the |DndComment| and the |DndSidebar|. The |DndComment| is breakable and can safely be used inline in the text.

	\begin{RpgTip}{This Is a Tip Box!}
	A |RpgTip| is a box for minimal highlighting of text. It lacks the ornamentation of |DndSidebar|, but it can handle being broken over a column.
	\end{RpgTip}



	\section{Narration}

	\begin{RpgNarration}
		Narration doesn't get a title -- but that's ok, because you're reading this out loud!
	\end{RpgNarration}

	\begin{RpgSidebar}[]{Behold the DndSidebar!}
  The |DndSidebar| is used as a sidebar. It does not break over columns and is best used with a figure environment to float it to one corner of the page where the surrounding text can then flow around it.
\end{RpgSidebar}

		\section{RpgMap}

		We're trying something here!
		\begin{RpgMap}[depth=0,title={A test map},prefix=Room~,blank-prefix=Cell~]
			
			\item[A place]s
			\begin{RpgMap}
				\item[Another place] 
				\item[test]
				\begin{RpgMap}
				\item[Another place] 
				\item[test]
				\item[tesdt]
				\item[tesdt]
				\item[tesdt]
			\end{RpgMap}
				\item[tesdt]
				\RpgArea{Hello} I am trying this one now
			\end{RpgMap}
			\item[here]
			% \item[Another]e
			% \item[Another]d
		\end{RpgMap}
		

		\begin{description}
			\item[it] still works
			\item[as] expected  
		\end{description}
