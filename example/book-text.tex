	\RpgDropCap{H}{ello and welcome!} This package is designed to aid you in writing beautifully typeset documents for a variety of RPG documents. It is derived from \href{https://github.com/rpgtex/DND-5e-LaTeX-Template}{a D\&D-specific package}, but whilst we have retained much of the internal engine, we have adapted it to work with a variety of themes, thus making it a system-agnostic \verb|rpgtex|.

	\chapter{Sections}
		\section{Section}
			Sections break up chapters into large groups of associated text.

			\subsection{Subsection}
				Subsections further break down the information for the reader.

				\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
					Subsubsections are the furthest division of text that still have a block header. Below this level, headers are displayed inline.

					\paragraph{Paragraph}
					The paragraph format is seldom used in the core books, but is available if you prefer it to the ``normal'' style.

					\subparagraph{Subparagraph}
					The subparagraph format with the paragraph indent is likely going to be more familiar to the reader.
