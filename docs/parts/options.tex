\chapter{Package Options}


	Whether the package is invoked directly, or through a class users have the option to pass options to it which change the behavior of the resulting document:
	\begin{lstlisting}
		\documentclass[<options>]{rpgbook/rpghandout}
		\usepackage[<options>]{rpgtex}
	\end{lstlisting}
	The options are either in the form of key-value pairs which set internal values, or flags which activate behavior when present. The available options are:
	\begin{macrolist}
		\RpgMacro{bg}{Controls the presence of the `background paper' and footer decorations.}
		{
			bg = <full / print / none>
		}{
			The value passed must be one of the three options (else an error is thrown). The most obvious effect of these three options is to change whether the `background paper' set by \cmdref{RpgSetPaper} appears in the document, or the footer decorations set by \cmdref{RpgSetFooterDecoration}.

			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{rcc}
					Command & Paper & Footer Decorations
					\\
					\texttt{full} & \cmark & \cmark
					\\
					\texttt{print} & \xmark & \cmark
					\\
					\texttt{none} & \xmark & \xmark
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}

			This flag also changes the behavior of the rpgcard class \RpgPage[p]{S:cardClass}, and other environments may similarly change their colours or layouts in response to the values passed to this command. Internally these commands are responding specifically to the presence of the paper or the footer flags.
		}
		\RpgMacro{justified}{A flag which, if present, activates justified-text mode. Otherwise, defaults to left-aligned, `ragged right'.}
		{}{}
		\RpgMacro{nomultitoc}{A flag which, if present, disabled the multi-column table of contents option}{}{}
		\RpgMacro{theme}{The initial value passed to \cmdref{RpgSetTheme} when package initialization is finished.}{}{ 
			The default value is \verb|default|, activating the Default Theme \RpgPage[p]{Theme:Default}.
		}
		\RpgMacro{themepath}{Calls \cmdref{RpgSetThemePath}, a directory holding multiple theme files used for auto-theme searches if a direct path not given}{}{
			Default value is \verb|\RpgPackagePath/themes|, with the assumption that the theme `name' is stored in \verb|themes/name/name.cfg|.
		}
		\RpgMacro{size}{Forwards the contents on to the base-class if \verb|layout| is active, thereby setting the font size}
		{
			size = <font-size>pt
		}
		{
			The allowed values depend on the class being used: the book class (on which rpgbook is based) for example, only accepts values in \{10pt,11pt,12pt\}. Other classes may accept different values.
		}
		\RpgMacro{columns}{Sets the number of columns the document is has}
		{
			columns = <1 / 2>
		}
		{
			Internally this calls either onecolumn or twocolumn. More advanced column-settings would require the user manually using \verb|multicols|.
		}
