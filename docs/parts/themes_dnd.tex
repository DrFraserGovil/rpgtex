		\subsection{Fonts}
			The default format defines only a single font: the Latin Modern Roman font, the standard \LaTeX{} font. For consistency with the rest of the library (which uses fontspec-defined fonts), we have used an OTF version of LMR which is bundled with the package.
			
			\RpgMacro{lrfont}{}{The name given to the Latin Modern Roman font-family (extended with a small-caps font; Latin Modern Roman Caps) defined by the default theme}{}{}{}

 			The values assigned to the font elements areas follows (note that \verb|\normalfont| is aliased to the value of RpgFontBody).

		\subsection{Colors}

			The default theme colors are largely monochromatic:

			\DefaultSwatches{}

		\subsection{Backgrounds \& Footers}
			The default theme defines no background or headers (and clears any existing ones). The footer consists of the chapter name and a page number, using the appropriate fonts (\cmd{RpgFontFooter} and \cmd{RpgFontPageNumber}). 


		\subsection{Text Boxes}

			The default text boxes are very simple in design:

			\begin{multicols}{3}
				
				\begin{RpgSidebar}{The RpgSidebar}
					Has minor decorations at the top and bottom to distinguish it from an RpgTip
				\end{RpgSidebar}
				
				\begin{RpgTip}{The RpgTip}
					Almost entirely undecorated
				\end{RpgTip}

				\begin{RpgNarration}
					RpgNarration is also simple; but uses the narration color
				\end{RpgNarration}
			\end{multicols}



        \subsection{Section Headers}

                Only chapters\footnote{If in an rpgbook / other class which support chapters} are numbered; all other section/subsections (etc.) are unnumbered. Otherwise there are no changes made to the titles aside from minor spacing changes, and the assignment of the relevant fonts.
          

              \begin{ExampleBlock}{Section Headers}
    \section{Example}
    \subsection{Another Example}
    \subsubsection{More Examples!}
            \end{ExampleBlock}

        \subsection{RpgDice}\index{RpgDice}
            
            The default RpgDice format is $n\mathrm d x + m$:
            \begin{ExampleBlock}{Default Dice}
            \RpgDice{3d8 -5 +2}
            \end{ExampleBlock}

	\section{RpgStatblock: dnd Version}\index{RpgStatblock!Theme!dnd}

		The dnd theme defines a special command which mimics the appearance of a monster statblock - particularly those in the more modern D\&D 2024 iteration.
