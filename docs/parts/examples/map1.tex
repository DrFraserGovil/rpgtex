\begin{RpgMap}[
        header-offset=1,%start at subsection
        title={Example Map}
    ]

    \RpgArea{The Spooky Mansion} 
        There are things here

    \begin{RpgMap}[
        title={ignored-as-nested}
        ]
        \RpgArea{Entrance Hall}
            Where you go to enter
        \RpgArea{Kitchen}
            Yum, food
    \end{RpgMap}

    \begin{RpgNestedArea}[][header-offset=2]
        {The Creepy Grounds}
		We set a header-offset for this nested block, so....
        \RpgArea{The gardens}
            Note that this is a paragraph, not a subsection
         \begin{RpgNestedArea}{The stables}
            Horses live(d) here.
			
			\RpgArea{Shire horse}
				A very big boi, which still keeps the parent's header-offset

			\RpgArea{Shetland pony}
				And a tiny one too!
		 \end{RpgNestedArea}
    \end{RpgNestedArea}

    \RpgArea{The Graveyard}
        The additional offset-didn't persist; we're back to subsections again, and the next element will be a subsubsection.

		\begin{RpgMap}[
			blank-prefix={Tomb~}
        	]
			\RpgArea{}
				This is an unnamed area - it gets given a slightly different name
			\RpgArea[tomb-ref]{}
				I might want to refer to this later, even though it is unnamed.
