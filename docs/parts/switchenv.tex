\chapter{Switchable Environments}

	Often it is convenient to be able to toggle between two different environments depending on an external flag. In the context of an RPG this might be for a number of reasons: having a player version and a GM version, or having a screen-readable version versus a printable one. 

	Whilst it is obviously possible to build an environment which performs the switching for you, we provide a generic interface for switching between \textit{similar environments}.

	\begin{RpgSidebar}{'Similar' Environments}
		It is important to note that this system only works for switching between environments which are `similar', insofar as they permit the same number and order of arguments, and interpret their contents similarly.

		An itemize and an enumerate are `similar': an itemize and a figure are not.
	\end{RpgSidebar}
