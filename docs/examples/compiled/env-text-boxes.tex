\begin{ExampleBlock}[][listing side text]{The Three Text Boxes}
\begin{RpgNarration}[color=blue!30!white]
   This is text that you would read out loud to players, describing a scene. It will always be blue, even if the theme says otherwise -- because the optional argument takes priority.
\end{RpgNarration}

\begin{RpgSidebar}{A Sidebar}
   This is an important block of text, that you should pay attention to.
\end{RpgSidebar}

\begin{RpgTip}{A Tip}
   This is some helpful - but not vital - text.
\end{RpgTip}
