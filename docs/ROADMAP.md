# Development Roadmap

This is a 'to do list' of features which are incomplete, in the works, or otherwise on my radar to add in the future. 

## Required Features

Features which *must* be added before the next major release

* Full documentation 
    * RpgCard object
    * rpgcard class
    * Theme documentation
        * Including 'how to write a theme' 
    * Some fonts are missing
* Revamp the example documents
* Create the `features' section on the README

## Desired Features

Features which would improve the package

* RpgClocks
* RpgStat card-mode for d&d.
* Character sheet interface/class
* Encounter tables / random tables / dice tables
* Full page images / landscape support
* `Fancy box' (i.e. the D&D class table wrapper environment)
* Circle/dot producers & fill-ins (i.e. for FitD skills)

### Low Priority

These are some desired features which are on the radar, but probably won't be high up my to-do list

* Inline text localisation (or `theme localisation').

## Internal Mechanics

Features which would improve the developer experience, but would not affect the user interface

* Complete the transition to the __rpg_add_key interface to simplify the vast number of keys
* Generate a more robust font-generation interface so that new fonts can be created in a single line
